  <h4>Returns with technical Issues</h4>
  <p>
    To ensure that the issue is with the device and not the installation all returns must go through Signal Booster South Africa technical Support to be qualified for a refund. Once we are satisfied that the issue cannot be resolved we will process your returns through the following process, to return your product our technical department will contact Signalbooster.co.za Customer Service and request an RMA code which includes a special returns address along with that authorization. Please note out repeaters only work when there is a signal to boost (>-85db), it is the client’s responsibility to check there is a signal available and refunds are not available where it is later found there is no viable outdoor signal. Once this improves the system will work.
  </p>
  <p>
    The product must be returned in a re-sellable condition.
  </p>
  <h4>Exceptions</h4>
  <p>
    Any returns received without an RMA authorization, outside of 15 days from the original delivery date, or to the wrong address will not be refunded.
