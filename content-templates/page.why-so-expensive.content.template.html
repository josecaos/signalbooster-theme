    <h4>
      The reasons why our boosters are more expensive than anyone else is as follow:
    </h4>
    <h5>
      <b>1)</b> Our Solutions are 100% ICASA Licensed, Legal, CRAN certified and CE Approved.
    </h5>
    <p>
      Our Technology is the original one.  In other words we are the creator and inventor of the technology and anyone else out there are simply pale reproductions.  It also means that our booster(s) will never interfere with any of your appliances or your neighbour's or with the tower of any service provider or with anything else at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also note that the options quoted are designed to boost all networks voice & data, 3G & 4G for up to 250sqm or 500sqm and that if you choose Vodacom only the price will be a lot more cost-effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our name (Company name) should give you the clue as we operate in 10 different countries world-wide.  We designed and patented the tech in Canada over 25 years ago and when we started to be successful, of course we've had competitors but they do not have our recipe.  It's a bit like comparing Coca-cola with pepsi or KFC with any other copy cats out there, it really is a matter of taste and choice.
    </p>

  <div class="page_content_block">

    <h5>
      <b>2)</b> The Technology has high filters on it and very low radiation and this is one of the main reasons, it is not harmful to your health.  For e.g when you look at an iphone or a Samsung or Sony etc - these mobile phones are the most expensive on the market place, why?  This is because of the filters it has but go out there and look for an unbranded mobile phone and see how cheap it is, why? Again this is due to the filters and the brand.  We are our own brand and the original.
    </h5>
    <p>
      The cheap ones out there have very high radiation, they are harmful to people's health, they will interfere with just about everything and anything and last but not least they will break quickly and easily as opposed to our own technology.

        I can always remember what my mum used to say as a child, "cheap is costly" and I could never understand what she meant but as I grew up I did.
      </p>
      Cheaper products causes a lot of headaches and they break quickly and easily.

        I hope that this helps you make an informed decision.
